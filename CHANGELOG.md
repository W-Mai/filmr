## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-06

### ✨ Features

- **Settings**: Add optional histogram smoothing toggle (3-tap `[1,2,1]/4` weighted average) to reduce visual jitter in shadow regions.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-06

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **Core**: Extracted spectral matrix computation into `FilmStock::compute_spectral_matrix()`, eliminating duplicated spectral integration logic across pipeline and processor modules.

### ✨ Features

- **GPU**: Enhanced develop shader with spectral/color dual matrix pipeline, shoulder softening compression, and logistic sigmoid H-D curve (replacing erf approximation) for better CPU/GPU consistency.
- **Grain**: Switched grain shader shadow noise model from inverse-distance to exponential decay (`exp(-2D)`), providing smoother shadow-to-midtone grain transitions.

### 🐛 Fixes
